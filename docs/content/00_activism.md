I care deeply about making Academia in General, and Science and specifically Astronomy in particular, a more welcoming environment for everyone. As such, I have participated in various conferences across the UK on LGBT+ inclusion (e.g. LGBTYS Youth Summit in Falkirk 2017, NUS LGBT+ Conference in Edinburgh 2018, among others). Further, I became a member of the Edinburgh University Sports Union Inclusion Committee, to advocate for equity and inclusion in university sports. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I set up LGBT+ lunch meetings at the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh, to provide a safe space for LGBT+ students to meet and foster a sense of community. I am currently in the process of setting up a similar initiative at the University of Heidelberg.

In February 2023, I organised "OUTer Space", an LGBT+ Outreach day at the Haus der Astronomie (House of Astronomy) in Heidelberg. I planned, organised, and executed the day consisting of a planetarium show, tours of the telescopes, the stellar model, as well as talks from LGBT+ Scientists and Allies and a Q&A Panel.

For the International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT) 2023 I organised a presentation at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, inviting Emily Hunt to speak about her experience with activism for greater LGBT+ inclusion within Astronomy.

Since 2023, I have been co-leading the "Queer International Meet-Up Heidelberg" as part of the PLUS Charity's offer of groups and meetings for queer people in the region.

I firmly believe that widening participation in Astronomy is crucial to the future of our field, and I am always keen to engage in initiatives to make this happen.
