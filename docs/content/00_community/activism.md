I planned, organised, and executed the day consisting of a planetarium show, tours of the telescopes, the stellar model, as well as talks from LGBT+ Scientists and Allies and a Q&A Panel.

### Equity, Diversity and Inclusion

I care deeply about making Academia in General, and Science and specifically Astronomy in particular, a more welcoming environment for everyone. Some of the things I have done in this regard include:

- Co-leading the "Queer International Meet-Up Heidelberg"
- Organised "OUTer Space"
- Organised a presentation at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy for IDAHOBIT
- Member of the Edinburgh University Sports Union Inclusion Committee
- Participated in various conferences across the UK on LGBT+ inclusion

For more information, click through the slideshow.

Further to these, during the Covid-19 pandemic, I set up LGBT+ lunch meetings at the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh, to provide a safe space for LGBT+ students to meet and foster a sense of community. I am currently in the process of setting up a similar initiative at the University of Heidelberg.

I firmly believe that widening participation in Astronomy is crucial to the future of our field, and I am always keen to engage in initiatives to make this happen.
