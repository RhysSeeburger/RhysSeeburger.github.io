As part of my PhD studies, I have been tutoring the "Fortgeschrittenen Praktikum" ("Advanced Practical") course at the University of Heidelberg, teaching Bachelor students about CCD photometry in modern Astronomy. I have also supervised the BOGY Internship of a highschool student at the Haus der Astronomie (House of Astronomy), and continue regular conversation by email with the student. Image: Yanu Khusanova

        For my Bachelor's, I participated in the "Science Education Placement", allowing me to help out at an Edinburgh high school for a semester. During the Placement, I observed lessons, aided in demonstrations, provided my input during lessons, and delivered my own lessons on various topics in Physics. I also participated in and lead the Astronomy Club on a few occasions, teaching students about a wide range of astronomical phenomena. I have since gone back to the school a few times to give further talks at the Astronomy Club. Image: Kim Traynor

        During my time at secondary school, I worked freelance as a student tutor, helping students with their homework and preparing them for exams. While at University of Edinburgh, I joined the Physics Peer Mentoring Scheme as a Peer Support Leader, where I helped first- and second-year students with their studies. Image: Vecteezy.com
