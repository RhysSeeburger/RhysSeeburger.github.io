title: Student Representation 

---

Making the voices of my fellow students heard is very important to me, and I have been involved in student representation for a number of years. While at the University of Edinburgh, I was the Astrophsics Degree Year Representative from 2019-2021, and chaired the Staff Student Liaison Committee for the School of Physics and Astronomy 2020-2021. In 2020-2021, I was also the School Convener for the School of Physics and Astronomy at Edinburgh. In 2021, I was elected IMPRS Representative for my cohort of Astronomy PhD students at the University of Heidelberg.
