- abstract: "We report spectroscopic and photometric follow-up of a dormant black\
    \ hole (BH) candidate from Gaia DR3. The system, which we call Gaia BH2, contains\
    \ a ~1 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> red giant and a dark companion with mass $M_2 = 8.9\\\
    pm 0.3\\, {\\rm M}_{\\odot }$ that is very likely a BH. The orbital period, P<SUB>orb</SUB>\
    \ = 1277 d, is much longer than that of any previously studied BH binary. Our\
    \ radial velocity (RV) follow-up over a 7-month period spans &gt;90 per cent of\
    \ the orbit's RV range and is in excellent agreement with the Gaia solution. UV\
    \ imaging and high-resolution optical spectra rule out plausible luminous companions\
    \ that could explain the orbit. The star is a bright (G = 12.3), slightly metal-poor\
    \ ($\\rm [Fe/H]=-0.22$) low-luminosity giant ($T_{\\rm eff}=4600\\, \\rm K$; $R\
    \ = 7.8\\, R_{\\odot }$; $\\log \\left[g/\\left({\\rm cm\\, s^{-2}}\\right)\\\
    right] = 2.6$). The binary's orbit is moderately eccentric (e = 0.52). The giant\
    \ is enhanced in \u03B1-elements, with $\\rm [\\alpha /Fe] = +0.26$, but the system's\
    \ Galactocentric orbit is typical of the thin disc. We obtained X-ray and radio\
    \ non-detections of the source near periastron, which support BH accretion models\
    \ in which the net accretion rate at the horizon is much lower than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton\
    \ rate. At a distance of 1.16 kpc, Gaia BH2 is the second-nearest known BH, after\
    \ Gaia BH1. Its orbit - like that of Gaia BH1 - seems too wide to have formed\
    \ through common envelope evolution. Gaia BH1 and BH2 have orbital periods at\
    \ opposite edges of the Gaia DR3 sensitivity curve, perhaps hinting at a bimodal\
    \ intrinsic period distribution for wide BH binaries. Dormant BH binaries like\
    \ Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2 significantly outnumber their close, X-ray bright cousins,\
    \ but their formation pathways remain uncertain."

- abstract: We report discovery of a bright, nearby ($G = 13.8;\, \, d = 480\, \rm
    pc$) Sun-like star orbiting a dark object. We identified the system as a black
    hole candidate via its astrometric orbital solution from the Gaia mission. Radial
    velocities validated and refined the Gaia solution, and spectroscopy ruled out
    significant light contributions from another star. Joint modelling of radial velocities
    and astrometry constrains the companion mass of $M_2 = 9.62\pm 0.18\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot
    }$. The spectroscopic orbit alone sets a minimum companion mass of $M_2\gt 5\,
    \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$; if the companion were a $5\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ star,
    it would be 500 times more luminous than the entire system. These constraints
    are insensitive to the mass of the luminous star, which appears as a slowly rotating
    G dwarf ($T_{\rm eff}=5850\, \rm K$, log g = 4.5, $M=0.93\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot
    }$), with near-solar metallicity ($\rm [Fe/H] = -0.2$) and an unremarkable abundance
    pattern. We find no plausible astrophysical scenario that can explain the orbit
    and does not involve a black hole. The orbital period, P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 185.6
    d, is longer than that of any known stellar-mass black hole binary. The system's
    modest eccentricity (e = 0.45), high metallicity, and thin-disc Galactic orbit
    suggest that it was born in the Milky Way disc with at most a weak natal kick.
    How the system formed is uncertain. Common envelope evolution can only produce
    the system's wide orbit under extreme and likely unphysical assumptions. Formation
    models involving triples or dynamical assembly in an open cluster may be more
    promising. This is the nearest known black hole by a factor of 3, and its discovery
    suggests the existence of a sizable population of dormant black holes in binaries.
    Future Gaia releases will likely facilitate the discovery of dozens more.

- abstract: 'We cross-matched the 4XMM-DR10 catalog with the HyperLEDA database and
    obtained a new sample of galaxies that contain X-ray sources. Excluding duplicate
    observations and false matches, we present a total of 7759 galaxies with X-ray
    sources. In the current work, we present general properties of the sample: namely
    the distribution in equatorial coordinates, radial velocity distribution, morphological
    type, and X-ray fluxes. The sample includes morphological classification for 5241
    galaxies with X-ray emission, almost half of which, 42%, are elliptical (E, E-S0).
    Most galaxies in the sample have nuclear X-ray emission (6313 or 81%), and the
    remaining 1443 (19%) present X-ray emission from the host galaxy. This sample
    can be used for future deep studies of multiwavelengths properties of the galaxies
    with X-ray emission.'

- abstract: 'We analyse two binary systems containing giant stars, V723 Mon (''the
    Unicorn'') and 2M04123153+6738486 (''the Giraffe''). Both giants orbit more massive
    but less luminous companions, previously proposed to be mass-gap black holes.
    Spectral disentangling reveals luminous companions with star-like spectra in both
    systems. Joint modelling of the spectra, light curves, and spectral energy distributions
    robustly constrains the masses, temperatures, and radii of both components: the
    primaries are luminous, cool giants ($T_{\rm eff,\, giant} = 3800$ and $4000\,
    \rm K$, $R_{\rm giant}= 22.5$ and $25\, {\rm R}_{\odot }$) with exceptionally
    low masses ($M_{\rm giant} \approx 0.4\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$) that likely fill their
    Roche lobes. The secondaries are only slightly warmer subgiants ($T_{\rm eff,\,
    2} = 5800$ and $5150\, \rm K$, $R_2= 8.3$ and $9\, {\rm R}_{\odot }$) and thus
    are consistent with observed UV limits that would rule out main-sequence stars
    with similar masses ($M_2 \approx 2.8$ and ${\approx}1.8\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$).
    In the Unicorn, rapid rotation blurs the spectral lines of the subgiant, making
    it challenging to detect even at wavelengths where it dominates the total light.
    Both giants have surface abundances indicative of CNO processing and subsequent
    envelope stripping. The properties of both systems can be reproduced by binary
    evolution models in which a $1{-}2\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ primary is stripped by
    a companion as it ascends the giant branch. The fact that the companions are also
    evolved implies either that the initial mass ratio was very near unity, or that
    the companions are temporarily inflated due to rapid accretion. The Unicorn and
    Giraffe offer a window into into a rarely observed phase of binary evolution preceding
    the formation of wide-orbit helium white dwarfs, and eventually, compact binaries
    containing two helium white dwarfs.'
